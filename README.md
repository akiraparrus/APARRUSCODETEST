### **Report for Analysis**

#### **2025 Japanese GP Predictions**
- **Predicted Winner**: Max Verstappen with a predicted race time of **96.98 seconds**.
- **Actual Winner**: Max Verstappen
- **Model Error (MAE)**: **0.09 seconds** – This indicates a high level of accuracy in the model's predictions for this race.

#### **2025 Chinese GP Predictions**
1. **Predicted Winner**: Lando Norris with a predicted race time of **103.91 seconds**.
2. **Actual Winner**: Oscar Piastri
- **Model Error (MAE)**: **1.35 seconds** – While the error is larger for the Chinese GP, the prediction is still relatively accurate considering potential external factors like track conditions, team strategies, etc.

#### **Additional Predictions**
- **Top 3 Predicted Drivers for the Japanese GP**:
   1. Max Verstappen
   2. Carlos Sainz Jr.
   3. Charles Leclerc

- **Actual Top 3 Finishers for the Japanese GP**:
   1. Max Verstappen
   2. Charles Leclerc
   3. Lando Norris

#### **Model Performance Evaluation**
- The **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** for the Japanese GP was **0.09 seconds**, suggesting the model performed well in predicting the race times.
- The **MAE for the Chinese GP** was **1.35 seconds**, indicating a larger deviation. This is still within a reasonable margin, but it suggests that other factors (e.g., strategy, pit stops, weather) impacted the race results more significantly for this particular GP.

#### **Conclusion**
- The model provides a strong foundation for race time predictions based on available data. 
- The performance can be further improved by incorporating additional features like car performance, weather conditions, and race strategies.
- The Japanese GP prediction shows the model's potential for accurate race time forecasting, whereas the Chinese GP prediction highlights areas for further refinement.
